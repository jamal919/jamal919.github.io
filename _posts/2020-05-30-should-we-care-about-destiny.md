I know a person, over the internet of course. He is kind, gentle, and very much hardworking. His life is full of miseries but what he achieved is enough to make your hat off. We had very few conversation, may be because of my lacking in social skills. But whenever I talk to him I feel an unknown type of respect for him. Its like when someone fly a plane without any kind of training or do some test perfectly without knowing the basic science or more generally when someone do something what I can’t do being more capable of him/her.

There is one thing though bother me much – he always speaks like he is unwanted in this world, everybody hates him. I can’t blame him because the environment he works is not actually that much good to be appreciated. But why I should care about what other thinks, especially when it affects mentally in a negative way? There are some reason of course, isn’t there ?

There is one other thing that people care too much about - density. Sometimes it feels like we think about our destiny like its something hardcoded. We try to evaluate wheater we are going to reach our destiny or not based on our current condition. It works like a catalyst for the frustration reaction! We do bad at some point and think we are lost. But I always picture destiny is the final evaluation and it is not affected by the intermediate path ( sounds like hess’s law, isn’t it ? ). Lets try a quote from the movie “The Last Samurai”  –

> Katsumoto: You believe a man can change his destiny?
> Algren: I think a man does what he can, until his destiny is revealed.

Although its pop culture, the wisdom is old. One can only do what one can do. The outcome depends on so many factors that it becomes very hard for our mind to comprehend how it will really turn out. We can make guesses, but we never know till the very end. This philosophy really demands one to do whatever one can do without fear.

But again, it is not easy if you are in a bad stretch. The trick to come out of bad stretch is just doing. Another story time - long ago there lived a donkey. One day while walking he fall on a well. The well was deep enough to stuck in. No matter how much the donkey tried it couldn’t reach the top.  He cried for help, but nobody came to save him. The owner of the well was a farmer. He thought the donkey is useless, and the well dried a long ago; so why we don’t just fill the well keeping the donkey inside! They started to throw dirt inside. The donkey couldn’t understand what was happening, when he understood he start to cry in top of his voice. He was getting buried alive!

But that not the story! While the farmer was filling up the well with dart, the donkey thought it is his last. He took a deep breath and accepted his current situation. He was not panicking anymore. And at that moment, a plan hit on him. Whenever someone throw a dirt on him, he give it a shake and stand on it. The more dirt the farmer threw, the more energetic the donkey became. Eventually the well got filled up and the donkey jumped out of the well.

If you feel like you are in a well of darkness then what you need to do is to shake the dirt off you and jump out of the well of frustration. We need not care about destiny if we care about our actions.
