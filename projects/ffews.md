title: Flash Flood Early Warning System (FFEWS)

Flash Flood Early Warning System (FFEWS) is a prject funded by IFAD through LGED to develop a flash flood forecasting system for the north-east region of Bangladesh. The region is known for it's production of Boro rice - a varient of rice that planted during winter and harvested during mid-April. The timing coincides with the pre-monsoon disturbences which produces sudden heavy rainfall over the Meghalaya, and subsequently flooding the crops just before harvesting.

We have developed a cascade modelling platform to predict such flooding, as well as relevant level estimate for triggering the flood warnings. The modelling system is currently being deployed at BWDB in DELFT-FEWS platform. An early version of the website, developed by me, for disseminating rainfall forecast can be accessed [here](https://ffews.github.io/).

The project is lead by Dr. AKM Saiful Islam at IWFM, BUET.
