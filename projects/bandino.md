The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is a very densely populated deltaic zone and one of the most vulnerable in the world to coastal risks. The region is exposed to strong tide, a sizable continental flow during monsoon, and occational cyclonic storms during pre- and post-monsoon. Being a deltaic zone, the region is very flat with more than 150 million people living below 5m mean sea level (MSL). Combination of all these components pose a great danger to the coastal community, and has been the case for many-a-year. For example, in 1970 a cyclonic storm caused more than 300,000 death and still in the memory of the livings! Particularly this event motivated the government to build coastal embankments to protect the region - while making the hydrodynamic system more complex. Despite these efforts, the death rally continued, with 150000 in 1991 cyclone, 10000 people in cyclone sidr (2009). This indicates major gaps in multiple sagments - the science of the water level dynamics, development and evloution of cyclones, mechanisms of cyclonic flooding, societal understanding of the risks and hazard to coordinate an efficient and timely response to such flooding threat.

BANgladesh Dynamique des INOndations (BANDINO) project aimed to understand the inundation dynamics of the Bengal delta - from large scale to small scale, and from time, as well as from long-period to short-period. The project is funded by CNES under the framework of TOSCA grants. This project is also the background project that funded the various activities for my PhD work - guided by Dr. Fabien Durand from IRD/France and Dr. Laurent Testut from CNAP/France.
