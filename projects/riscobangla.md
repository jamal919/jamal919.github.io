The RISCOBANGLA project aims to carry out bathymetry and bottom ocean pressure measurements for the first time in the coastal areas of the Bengal Delta, in order to characterize sea states and better understand their contribution to coastal risks. In particular, we expect that the extremely low slopes of the coastlines bordering the Bengal delta induce singular behaviors concerning the dissipation of waves and the generation of long waves during storms. In the absence of in situ observations, the numerical models implemented in this region by several international teams use default parameters to represent these phenomena, which probably leads to very large errors.

This project is funded by CNRS-IRD MITI fund, and lead by Dr. Xavier Bertin at LIENSs.
